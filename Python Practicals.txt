1) Define Python Functions and explain how to create a function in
Python Programming with detailed steps?

Ans. 
FUNCTION is a block of code which only runs when it is called. we cam pass data, known as parameters, into a function. A function return data as a result.
In Python, we define a function with the def keyword, then write a function identifier (name) followed by parentheses and a colon. 
The next thing we have to do is make sure you indent with a tab or 4 spaces, then specify what you want the function to do for you.




2)Write a Python Program that takes a list and returns a new list
with unique elements of the first list.

PROCEDURE:-

def unique_list(mylist):
    new_list = []
    for numbers in mylist:
        if numbers not in  new_list:
            new_list.append(numbers)
    return new_list

print(unique_list([1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,4,5,5,5])) 




3) Write a Python Program to print the even numbers from a given
list.
PROCEDURE:-

def is_even_number(mylist):
    evennumbers = []
    for numbers in mylist:
        if numbers % 2 == 0:
            evennumbers.append(numbers)
    return evennumbers
        
print(is_even_number([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]))    

    
        

4) Write a Python Program to print the odd numbers from a given list.
PROCEDURE:-

def is_odd_number(mylist):
    oddnumbers = []
    for numbers in mylist:
        if numbers % 2 == 1:
            oddnumbers.append(numbers)
    return oddnumbers

print(is_odd_number([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]))
